I sketched up layout designs in my notebook and developed that into the final designs you see now.

It serves as both a source of that information and a demonstration of my abilities as both a designer and a developer.

We worked through multiple iterations of how the confetti could look and behave, finding and referencing other examples we could find online and taking inspiration from those. We ended up landing on the confetti count growing as the tip amount increased, and having all the buttons fire their confetti when the \"Custom\" option is selected.\n\nWorking in a collaborative space, feedback from me and others outside the design team came together to reach the final product that we were all proud about. In the end we ended up with something that encourages and rewards tipping, helping the customer feel celebrated for wanting to support creators they love, and helping creators through this encouraging and more fun tipping process.",

The theme of the jam was \"Take Care\", and after going through a difficult few weeks leading up to the jam I decided to make a silly game about baking cookies. I made all the art pastel, round, cute and fun and focused the project/'s visual aspects and general game feel. I aimed to make the project as polished as possible in the limited time available. The gameplay consists of getting a random recipe and baking to it's specifications using the ingredients on the table, placing the dough on a baking sheet and seeing how the cookies came out. It's inspired by cooking mini-games in games I played growing up like in the Nancy Drew franchise.\n\nI spent most of the jam perfecting the visual aspects and testing the mechanics and game loop over and over until I felt like it read clearly, and that the charm and heart I was trying to convey came across. I iterated on how the specific interactions between the player and the game worked in order to reach a state where there's some level of effort, but that the chill relaxed and laid back vibe I was going for was achieved. During the jam I was also a mod for the jam's community spaces and managed answering questions and the chat for the finale stream to keep things running smoothly.",

The idea came from me having a physical bookshelf with some of my games on it that could be fun to peruse when trying to figure out what kind of game I wanted to play that evening, and not feeling like there was a good solution for digital game collections.\n\nSince game libraries now are often spread across physical copies spanning multiple consoles and multiple online stories, it can also be hard to have a true stock of every game you own.

It's handled using a tree implemented in json giving each group of dialogue an id, potential player responses if applicable, and corresponding id to go to after the dialogue is finished. Each dialogue option also has the potential different id's depending on the players choices and decisions. To simulate typing time, lines of dialogue can also specify a delay.
