We ended up landing on the confetti count growing as the tip amount increased and having all the buttons fire their confetti when the \"Custom\" option is selected.\n\nWorking in a collaborative space, feedback from me and others outside the design team came together to reach the final product we were all proud of.

We discussed and iterated on what actions were the most significant factors in a successful store and which ones were most important that they should be required. We went back on forth on the best behavior and layout for the checklist, whether it should propagate between pages, be opened automatically on page load, and so on. We landed on staying on every page in the dashboard and being integrated into the same bar to have it be in a consistent and fixed position across pages. The list is also automatically opened on the desktop to ensure the creator sees what they need to do whenever they navigate to a page, at least until they've completed the initial required steps. On mobile, a pulsing animation plays to draw attention to the button without covering all the page contents on page load. Once the list has been opened, the pulsing animation stops as not to distract or annoy the user.\n\nThere was a big emphasis on collaboration for this project. My input directly led to the decisions we reached and greatly improved the overall user experience to decrease the likelihood of creators bouncing on the product before completing onboarding. The list carrying between pages, mobile behavior, tooltip descriptions, and optional actions being split into a different category resulted from my suggestions and feedback. I also worked closely with the backend developer to best implement the data model for what items had been completed and how to represent that data.",

The jam's theme was \"Take Care,\" and after going through a difficult few weeks leading up to the event, I decided to make a silly game about baking cookies. I made all the art pastel, round, cute, and fun and focused the project/'s visual aspects and general game-feel. I aimed to make the project as polished as possible in the limited time available. The gameplay consists of getting a random recipe and baking to its specifications using the ingredients on the table, placing the dough on a baking sheet, and seeing how the cookies came out. It's inspired by cooking mini-games in games I played growing up, like in the Nancy Drew franchise.\n\nI spent most of the jam perfecting the visual aspects and testing the mechanics and game loop over and over until I felt like it read clearly, and that the charm and heart I was trying to convey came across. I iterated on how the specific interactions between the player and the game worked to reach a state where there's some level of effort, but that it maintained the chill, relaxed and laid-back vibe I was going for. During the jam, I was also a mod for the jam's community spaces and managed to answer questions and the chat for the finale stream to keep things running smoothly.",

I realized that there was no equivalent for digital game collections.\n\nSince modern game libraries are spread across physical copies spanning multiple consoles and multiple online stores, it can also be hard to have an accurate stock of every game you own.

Despite the obfuscated text, there are multiple endings and branching dialogue that the player can glean from message lengths and diverging player options. The dialogue system was created using a tree implementation in JSON, giving each section of dialogue an id, potential player responses if applicable, and a corresponding id to go to after that dialogue section finishes. Each dialogue option also has a list of the possible different corresponding follow-up ids depending on the player's choices and decisions. To simulate typing time, lines of dialogue can also specify a delay, which emulates the person on the other end of the phone's emotional state, sending short messages with longer timers to signify distress or hesitance.",
