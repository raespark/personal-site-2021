All components used on the site were designed and implemented by me, including the contact form which hooks into netlify to pass along interest messages. I sketched up layout designs in my notebook and developed that into the final designs you see now. All the art/self portraits used are also drawn and rendered by me! \n\nI wanted this project to serve as a living resume, featuring my work history, information about me, and a list of notable projects I worked on or contributed to. It serves as both a source of that information and a demonstration of my abilities as both a designer and a developer. I aimed to make it as delightful and smooth to use as possible, and tested as ",

I worked 1-on-1 with one of the designers to iterate quickly through options and solutions. We worked through multiple iterations of how the confetti could look and behave, finding and referencing other examples we could find online and taking inspiration from those. We ended up landing on the confetti count growing as the tip amount increased, and having all the buttons fire their confetti when the \"Custom\" option is selected.\n\nWorking in a collaborative space, feedback from me and others outside the design team came together to reach the final product that we were all proud about. In the end we ended up with something that encourages and rewards tipping, helping the customer feel celebrated for wanting to support creators they love, and helping creators through this encouraging and more fun tipping process.",

        "description": "A game I built for a game jam hosted by Extra Credits in 2020. The theme of the jam was \"Take Care\", and after going through a difficult few weeks leading up to the jam I decided to make a silly game about baking cookies. I made all the art pastel, round, cute and fun and focused the project/'s visual aspects and general game feel. I aimed to make the project as polished as possible in the limited time available. The gameplay consists of getting a random recipe and baking to it's specifications using the ingredients on the table, placing the dough on a baking sheet and seeing how the cookies came out. It's inspired by cooking mini-games in games I played growing up like in the Nancy Drew franchise.\n\nI spent most of the jam perfecting the visual aspects and testing the mechanics and game loop over and over until I felt like it read clearly, and that the charm and heart I was trying to convey came across. I iterated on how the specific interactions between the player and the game worked in order to reach a state where there's some level of effort, but that the chill relaxed and laid back vibe I was going for was achieved. During the jam I was also a mod for the jam's community spaces and managed answering questions and the chat for the finale stream to keep things running smoothly.",
