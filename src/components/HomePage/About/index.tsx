                        I'm a programmer that also dabbles in other hobbies like
                        drawing, crafting, sewing, cosplaying, writing and more!
                        I love being creative and bringing something from an
                        abstract idea into something tangible and real. I'm a

                        cute, colorful, pastel keyboards. I'm also a huge fan of
                        gaming in general, especially Pok√©mon! I enjoy being
                        with friends either online or in person (when that was a
                        thing) or hanging out on my couch playing games on my
                        Nintendo Switch, getting lost in it's games' fantastical
                        worlds.
