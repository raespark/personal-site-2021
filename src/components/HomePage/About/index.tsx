                        Hey! I'm Rachael, or Rae! I'm a programmer that also

                        sewing and cosplaying and writing and...wow I have too

                        obsession is cute pastel keyboards. You can also never
                        go wrong with Pok√®mon with me. Most evenings you can
                        either catch me chilling with online friends over
                        discord, or hanging on a couch playing games on my
                        Nintendo Switch.

                        amazing user experiences. I even have some minor
                        experience with designing UI's myself. I definitely
                        wouldn't call myself an expert, but I designed this site

                        I've worked in developing small little video games in my
                        free time, but have also been working on production
                        level web applications since before I graduated from
                        college through my summer internships! I love crafting
                        and building experiences that are a delight to use, and
                        writing code that I'm proud of. If there's something I
                        think feels unintuitive or clunky, I'm not afraid to let
                        you know!
